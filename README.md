To optimize Index.html, I did the following:

1. In-lined some of the CSS in the HTML. Mainly the CSS needed to render the above the fold content including header. 
2. Reduced the size of the images and specified the image size in the HTML
3. Moved the scripts to the end of the HTML
4. Minified the CSS. 

To optimize views/js/main.js, I did the following: 
1. Improved the updatedPositions function
2. Improved the function for page at load
3. Create the pizzas in memory
4. Append the pizzas once 
5. Minified main.js
